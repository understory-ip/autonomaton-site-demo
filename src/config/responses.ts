**Key Themes:**
• Project planning and architecture decisions
• API integration patterns
• Performance optimization ideas

1. Review the caching strategy
2. Document the routing logic
3. Set up monitoring

**Insights:**
Your notes show a focus on system reliability and maintainability. Consider scheduling a review session to prioritize these items.`

**Overview:**
Based on current best practices and recent developments...

**Key Findings:**
1. Modern approaches favor declarative over imperative patterns
2. Separation of concerns improves maintainability
3. Observability is increasingly important

**Recommendations:**
• Start with a minimal implementation
• Iterate based on actual usage patterns
• Build in telemetry from day one

**Sources to explore:**
• Technical documentation
• Community case studies
• Reference implementations`

**Subject:** Follow-up: ${context}

Hi team,

I wanted to follow up on our recent discussion about ${context}.

Here are the key points:
• [Point 1]
• [Point 2]
• [Point 3]

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards

I've noticed a pattern in your requests. Here's what I can automate:

**Trigger:** When you mention "${topic}"
**Action:** Automatically [describe action]
**Zone:** Would recommend GREEN (autonomous)

**Benefits:**
• Saves ~2 minutes per occurrence
• Reduces cognitive load
• Consistent execution

Shall I create this skill?`

**Summary Statistics:**
• Total records: 1,247
• Date range: Last 30 days
• Key metric trend: +12.3%

**Insights:**
1. Notable spike on day 15 correlates with product launch
2. Weekday performance 23% higher than weekends
3. Top segment contributes 67% of total

**Recommendations:**
• Focus resources on high-performing segments
• Investigate the day-15 spike for replication
• Consider weekend-specific strategies

This action is in the **RED ZONE** — human-only.

**What I can tell you:**
• Current system status: Healthy
• Last deployment: 3 days ago
• Pending changes: 2 PRs merged

**What you need to do:**
1. Review the changes manually
2. Run the deployment checklist
3. Execute the deployment yourself

This action is in the **RED ZONE** — human-only.

**What I can tell you:**
• Affected records: Unknown without explicit query
• Recovery options: Depends on backup status
• Impact assessment: Potentially severe

**If you need to proceed:**
1. Verify backup status
2. Document the reason
3. Execute manually with appropriate access

*This is a guardrail, not a limitation. Destructive actions require human judgment.*`

However, I couldn't match it to a specific intent in my routing configuration.

**Options:**
1. Rephrase with clearer keywords
2. Check the routing.config for available intents
3. This might be a new pattern — consider proposing a skill

*Tip: Common intents include capturing ideas, summarizing notes, drafting emails, and research.*`
