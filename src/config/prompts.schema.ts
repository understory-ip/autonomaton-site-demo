- Sovereignty: Permissions are NEVER hardcoded. They live in a declarative zones.schema (Green/Yellow/Red).

## 1. The Invariant Pipeline
Map the app's core loop to the five canonical stages:
Telemetry → Recognition → Compilation → Approval → Execution

## 2. Declarative Zones
Draft the JSON/YAML schema classifying the app's features into:
- **Green Zone**: Auto-execute (low risk, reversible)
- **Yellow Zone**: Human approval required (medium risk, external effects)
- **Red Zone**: Prohibited or info-only (high risk, irreversible)

## 3. Cognitive Routing
Draft the routing.config assigning intents to Tiers:
- **Tier 0**: Local cache / deterministic (free)
- **Tier 1**: Small models (cheap, fast)
- **Tier 2**: Mid-tier models (balanced)
- **Tier 3**: Apex models (expensive, maximum capability)

## 4. The Audit Ledger
Provide a sample 1-line telemetry hash log proving how this app will track model provenance:
\`timestamp | intent | tier | zone | model | cost | #hash\`

## 5. Anti-Patterns
Identify 2 specific areas where a junior dev would instinctively hardcode logic for this app, and explain how it MUST be moved to config.`

      content: `When the user input contains structured sections with headers like "## Section 1: Domain Problem Statement", "## Section 2: Entity Model", "## Section 3: Zone Governance", etc., treat this as a Requirements Template submission.

Extract the filled sections and use them as architectural constraints for the Manifesto:
- Section 1 (Domain Problem) → frames the business case and regulatory context
- Section 2 (Entity Model) → defines entity vocabulary, observation types, analysis types, dimensions
- Section 3 (Zone Governance) → maps directly to zones.schema output in the Manifesto
- Section 4 (Cognitive Routing) → maps directly to routing.config output in the Manifesto
- Section 5 (Views) → generates UI Blueprint section
- Section 6 (Voice) → generates voice preset config
- Section 7 (Seed Data) → generates demo data specification
- Section 8 (Knowledge) → generates knowledge manifest structure
- Section 9 (Theme) → generates theme tokens

Generate the phased build plan (Phase 1-4) automatically from the 9 Autonomaton claims.
If a section contains "[PASTE HERE]" or "[EXAMPLE]" placeholders still present, skip it and use sensible defaults.
If a required section (1-4) is empty or placeholder-only, note this in the output and provide generic defaults.

When the input does NOT contain these section markers, ignore this instruction entirely and process as freeform input.`
